# Sorting Algorithm Visualization

## Overview

This project provides visualizations for popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. The goal is to help users understand how these algorithms work by visually presenting the sorting process on an array of bars.

## Features

- Visualization of Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort algorithms.
- Adjustable array size with a slider for dynamic testing.
- Color-coded bars to represent the state of each element during the sorting process.
- Responsive design for a seamless user experience on different devices.

## Demo

[Insert a link to the live demo or a GIF/video showcasing the visualizations.]

## Usage

1. Open the project in your preferred web browser.
2. Adjust the array size using the slider.
3. Choose a sorting algorithm (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, or Insertion Sort).
4. Click the "Sort" button to start the visualization.
